#** Command-line Options:
#**
#**  --root DIR       Defines the directory that contains the various
#**                   $HOST.website subdirectories, each containing web content 
#**                   for a single virtual host.  If launched as root and if
#**                   "--user USER" also appears on the command-line and if
#**                   "--jail 0" is omitted, then the process runs in a chroot
#**                   jail rooted at this directory and under the userid USER.
#**                   This option is required for xinetd launch but defaults
#**                   to "." for a stand-alone web server.
#**
#**  --port N         Run in standalone mode listening on TCP port N
#**
#**  --user USER      Define the user under which the process should run if
#**                   originally launched as root.  This process will refuse to
#**                   run as root (for security).  If this option is omitted and
#**                   the process is launched as root, it will abort without
#**                   processing any HTTP requests.
#**
#**  --logfile FILE   Append a single-line, CSV-format, log file entry to FILE
#**                   for each HTTP request.  FILE should be a full pathname.
#**                   The FILE name is interpreted inside the chroot jail.  The
#**                   FILE name is expanded using strftime() if it contains
#**                   at least one '%' and is not too long.
#**
#**  --https          Indicates that input is coming over SSL and is being
#**                   decoded upstream, perhaps by stunnel.  (This program
#**                   only understands plaintext.)
#**
#**  --family ipv4    Only accept input from IPV4 or IPV6, respectively.
#**  --family ipv6    These options are only meaningful if althttpd is run
#**                   as a stand-alone server.
#**
#**  --jail BOOLEAN   Indicates whether or not to form a chroot jail if 
#**                   initially run as root.  The default is true, so the only
#**                   useful variant of this option is "--jail 0" which prevents
#**                   the formation of the chroot jail.
#**
#**  --max-age SEC    The value for "Cache-Control: max-age=%d".  Defaults to
#**                   120 seconds.
#**
#**  --max-cpu SEC    Maximum number of seconds of CPU time allowed per
#**                   HTTP connection.  Default 30.  0 means no limit.
#**
#**  --debug          Disables input timeouts.  This is useful for debugging
#**                   when inputs is being typed in manually.
#**
#** Command-line options can take either one or two initial "-" characters.
#** So "--debug" and "-debug" mean the same thing, for example.
